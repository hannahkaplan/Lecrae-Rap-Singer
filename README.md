# Lecrae Singer
 sent analysis for Lecrae albums

I was curious to see the mapped out course of Lecrae’s political journey, as well as the outcome of his beliefs through the details of his lyrics and art. 
Lecrae notably caused tension throughout the Christian community as his rap began to reflect his shifting values. 
Yet, he stands as a clear voice of someone who represents a combination of the two cultures, allowing him to promote social change and to challenge the 
perceived notion of these stark cultural differences. 

Through python and sentiment analysis tools I was able to sift through a few of Lecrae’s albums to see whether or not the lyrics reflected a change in values and beliefs over time. I first cleaned the data by removing punctuation and or spaces, as well as any words my sentiment analysis tool deemed less meaningful - i.g.  words most commonly used and therefore pertaining little value to the analysis. I then looked for common themes throughout the albums and the rate at which these themes exists over time. Below, I have mapped album releases, coinciding political moments, as well as text sentiment word clouds graphed by album.
